# SI 506: Problem Set 10
This week, you will be using list comprehension and dictionary comprehension together with json, APIs, classes(inheritance), methods, and functions in order to construct a main() function that will convert url representations to object representations and then to meaningful JSON representations. You will need to make use of an additional file, <Luke.json>, to complete this assignment. The skeleton code file, problem_set_10.py, contains areas that need your work, which are demarcated by "TO DO:".

Retrieve the problem set 10 template file and README in Canvas Files or from the Github
[SI506-2020Winter](https://github.com/umsi-arwhyte/SI506-2020Winter/tree/master/code/problem_set_10)
repo.

When you have completed the problem set click on the Gradescope link in Canvas and upload your
`problem_set_10.py` file to the Gradescope site.  Your submission will be auto-graded and any runtime
errors encountered will be recoded and displayed.  You may re-submit your assignment as many
times as is necessary before the close date.  Late submissions will be penalized as described
in the syllabus.
